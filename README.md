Scoring system.

Squirtles are rated between 30-100.

Squirtles below 45 are not worth running and only good for turtle soup. It felt wrong to have the lowest point be 30 when we already set requirements for 30 spa, 21 atk, 16 def and 21 spe.

Bad but runnable 45-55

Adequate 55-65

Good 65-75

Great 75-90

Amazing 90+
